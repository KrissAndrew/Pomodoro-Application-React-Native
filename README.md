This is my first independant React Native application. I intend to create an pomodoro technique application. What is meant by pomodoro?
The pomodoro technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by 3-to-5 minute breaks and 15-to-30 minute breaks following the completion of four work periods. ... Each working interval is called a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato (plural: pomodori), so named for the inventor's use of a tomato-shaped timer.

The pomodoro technique has been useful to me the last few years as I work towards my two degrees. It presents a simple application idea to me that feels like a good place to
start with React Native programming.

The application will present the user with a timer (originally set at 25 minutes) that can be toggled up or down. Three buttons will allow the user to either start, stop, or reset
the timer. Upon completion of the timer a sound will alert the user and a screen will display a message to remind the user to take a short break as per the techniques method.
